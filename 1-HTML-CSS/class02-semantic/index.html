            Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh <br /><br />
            I feel so unsure <br />
            As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor <br />
            As the music dies, something in your eyes <br />
            Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes <br />

            I'm never gonna dance again <br />
            Guilty feet have got no rhythm <br />

            I should've known better than to cheat a friend <br />
            And waste the chance that I'd been given <br />
            So I'm never gonna dance again <br />
            The way I danced with you, oh-oh <br />

            Time can never mend <br />
            The careless whispers of a good friend <br />
            To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind <br />
            There's no comfort in the truth, pain is that all you'll find <br />

            Never without your love <br />
            <br />
            Tonight the music seems so loud <br />
            I wish that we could lose this crowd <br />
            Maybe it's better this way <br />
            We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say <br />

            We could have been so good together <br />
            We could have lived this dance forever <br />
            But now, who's gonna dance with me? <br />
            Please stay <br />
